Alchemy was designed to provide easy and quick customization, this starter is not a theme, is a boilerplate.

Use this boilerplate to design your own site from the ground up.

Just watch the structure, navigate through files and get to know how everything fits together, then make the appropriate changes.

This starter focuses on working with PostCSS, it contains some useful plugins out of the box, read more on the [Github readme](https://github.com/bntzio/gatsby-starter-alchemy#postcss-plugins).
